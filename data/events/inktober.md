Come join in the fun at our joint meeting with The Drawing Sessions. We'll be catching up on Inktober prompts and stuffing our faces with free food!

If you don't know already, Inktober is a world-wide daily art challenge throughout the month of October, where you can practice and hone your skills in a fun and exciting way!

REMINDER: If you ordered a T-shirt, then come pick it up at this meeting!
